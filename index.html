	<p>Hi Everyone! We're super excited to have you celebrate with us! We figure that one party is great, but two is better, so we'll be having events in both Hawaii and Colorado. Come to whichever you'd like! Hawaii will be an informal party at Honolulu Beerworks on May 12, 2018. The Colorado event details are TBD, but we are planning on having a weekend away with whoever can join in Fall 2019. Stay tuned!</p>
