        <h1>About Carl</h1>
<p> Hello World,</p>
<p>I’m Carl. I’m an Environmental Engineer with CDM Smith, currently based in Honolulu, Hawaii, and am a registered Professional Civil Engineer in Washington and Hawaii. Currently, I’m the Project Manager of a $17M Water Master Planning project, and PM/Technical Lead on several industrial advanced water treatment projects.</p>
<p>My strengths include a strong, practical design sense, and an understanding of how physical and mechanical systems will integrate, operate, and work cohesively as a whole. I am quickly able to identify the critical needs and drivers for processes, technologies, or disciplines I am new to, and understand how to each system should be integrated into the project to efficiently and elegantly solve problems. I apply this systems understanding to Project Management as well, where I am able to join teams and quickly help pinpoint challenging areas of the project, and identify ways to mitigate or resolve long-standing issues.<br><br>
I value client interaction, client service, and integrity above all else. My goal is to leave a client with the best solution to their true problem, recognizing that the solution proposed in an RFP may not always be the correct solution for the root problem. All the while, I understand that non-technical constraints may limit technical approaches, and the worst plan or design is the one that stays on the shelf.<br><br>
I have a strong understanding of construction, how things are built, and the practical requirements for building. I also understand that often the most experienced experts are the folks that are building or operating the project, and their input should be sought early and heavily considered.<br><br>
My water treatment experience includes serving as the membrane filtration technical lead and civil site designer for a 30-mgd design-build ultrafiltration plant in California. As part of a large multi-disciplinary team, I finalized design past 65%, performed engineering services during construction, and was the technical lead for startup and commissioning.<br>
My water reclamation experience includes serving as Deputy PM, civil lead, process designer, and ESDC lead for a 440-mgd headworks retrofit that included all new fine screening, screenings conveyance, and a new building for screenings processing and load-out. I have also completed several wastewater treatment plant assessments with recommendations for long-term capital improvements.<br></p>
